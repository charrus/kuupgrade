# kuupgrade (Kernel Ubuntu Upgrade)

Work in progress - so far just some classes for interacting with ubuntu mainlie kernel PPA and locally installed kernels.

Ultimately it'll have facilities to query available kernels, and the ability to upgrade to the latest, or latest point.

It's very alpha - so will change a lot.
